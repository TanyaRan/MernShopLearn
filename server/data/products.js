In the westernmost part of the Rhodope part of Dabrash are two interesting phenomena - the Wedding (Druman rocks) and the impressive, sacred peak Mitrovica, overlooking the valley of the river Mesta, dotted with bizarre rock formations and offering unique panoramas in all directions. In the northern Pirin it is even more winter, but in the south it is already under the control of spring. Therefore, you will head to its most panoramic and second highest peak - Sveshtnik.`,
